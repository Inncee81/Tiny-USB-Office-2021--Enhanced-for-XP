KEYS

SPACE = fire hook
ESC = quit game
ALT = pause

S = save screen shot
M = hide mouse pointer
TAB = boss key (toggle)

Basics:

Shoot the super electromagnetic wire into the floating platforms.
When it takes hold you will climb upwards.
If your player falls of screen, it is game over.

Deciding the firing angle:
Position of mouse cursor inside the window.
The radar is displayed at the bottom of the window, which makes it easy to gauge firing angle.
Depending on the distance of the mouse from the radar, the rate of change of the angle will vary.
The best position is down to personal preference.

Firing:
Click left mouse button or press the space bar to release the wire.

Game Over: 
There is no end to the game in Wire Hang.
