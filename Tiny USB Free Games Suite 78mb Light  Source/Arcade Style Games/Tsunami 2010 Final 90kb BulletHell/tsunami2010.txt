TSUNAMI 2010
psychedelic oldschool abstract electronic
space-shooter pixel-overdose fun in 96kb!

_________________________________________
=========================================


welcome shooter-fans..

finally it's been released.. tsunami 2010..
after weeks of delay.. (real life rulez! ;)
so pleeeeaze enjoy and play it like nutz!!!


celebrating the upcoming 10th anniversary of
yak's mega-superb jaggy-t2k (which is still
one of my all-time favourite games!) and
making one of my oldest dreams come true..
(=coding a totally new t2k-pcee-rmx-conversion.. ;)

there are a LOT of differences between
the old jaggy version and this one..
not only concerning the gfx+rendering, of course..
(although these are the coolest new features.. =)

(100!) rmxd levels, (14!) rmxd enemies,
(a hell lot of!) rmxd bonus-items,
rmxd gameplay, rmxd everything..
so it even deserved a new name.. ;)

so here it is.. relax and enjoy..
cause THIS was made for YOU!


this software was done in my spare time
and you should have got it for free..
since i don't want to make profit with this
game you don't have to pay anything for it..
(it was made to learn more about gfx/sound-coding
 and especially game-design (i'm still a student :)
 so i hope there won't be any lawyers pissing
 me off because of copyright-stuff!
 cause everything you got with this release
 is 101% selfmade.. the textures/enemies/animations/
 soundfx/muzix/etc. are synthesized when tsunami is
 started/during gameplay (=calculated from scratch!)
 to get the game as small as it is now.. so there's
 NO stolen/ripped stuff included!!!  >)


------------------------------------------------
JUST ONE MORE IMPORTANT THINGIE ABOUT THE MUZIK:
------------------------------------------------

please do yourself a favour and
get some more stompin' muzik-files
to extend the game to a pure 101%
ultra-zen-pleasure-experience..
you're able to choose between:

a)TEMPEST2000(R)-PC-CDROM or TEMPEST2000(R)-SOUNDTRACK-CD or DEFENDER2000(R)-SOUNDTRACK-CD
  (easy: simply insert the cd into that cdrom drive
  which you use to listen your music-cds with)

b)TEMPEST2000(R)-JAGUAR-MODS
  (almost easy: copy all of the seven mod-files (although track 3 isn't really needed)
   (T2000-1.mod .. T2000-7.mod) or (Tempest_2k_1.mod .. Tempest_2k_7.mod)
  into the T2010 game folder)
c)DEFENDER2000(R)-JAGUAR-MODS
  (almost easy: copy all of the six mod-files
   (D2000-1.mod .. D2000-6.mod)
  into the T2010 game folder)

d)JUST-ANY-MUSIC-CD
  (easy: choose between random or linear track selection
     or: create your own playlist (->user_cd.ini)
          each line of it should contain one track-number
           Line1:    Menu
           Line2:    Bonus
           Line3-12: Levels)
  (recommended music: psytrance/goa.. of course.. ;)

e)JUST-ANY-MODS
  (almost easy: create your own playlist (->user_mods.ini)
    each line of it should contain one mod-filename (myfilename.mod or just myfilename)
     Line1:   Menu
     Line2:   Bonus
     Line3-6: Levels)
  (recommended music: oldskool amiga game tunes.. f.e. projectx,killinggameshow,supercars,..,..,..
                      demo(scene)tunes.. chiptunes..)


then select your favourite muzik-scheme inside the "start game"-menu..


the jaggy-t2k/d2k-mods can be downloaded f.e. from the following sites:
 -> http://www.ntrautanen.fi/marko/sao/musiikki/musiikki_jagge.htm

legal issue: d'load only if you've bought the original jaggy-games!

  ->some (nt only?-)nvidia-gl-drivers using fullscreen-anti-aliasing are buggy during zapper-effect -> black polys! (one can't see the level-grid/enemies/.. anymore)
  ->some old ati-gl-drivers using fullscreen-anti-aliasing are buggy -> the glow-effect of the level-grid is totally f**ked up)
