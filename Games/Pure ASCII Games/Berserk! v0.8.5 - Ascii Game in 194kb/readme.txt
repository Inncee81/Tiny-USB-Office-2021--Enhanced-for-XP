 Berserk! 7DRL version (7 DAY ROGUELIKE)
=============================================================================

Here you have it -- Berserk! the game of tactical bloodshed!

The inspiration for this little piece came from the great Anime and Manga "Berserk". It bases on the dark fantasy setting of humans vs. demons, and the concept of a inhumanly strong berserker warrior fighting a doomed defensive battle of survival against the overwhelming demonic forces. There's only one goal -- survive as long as possible. That's why the playing field is limited only to the battleground (running away is pointless...). Also, the capabilities of the main character are based around Gutts from Berserk.

Contrary to DoomRL and DiabloRL, I wasn't following the setting -- this is not a game for Berserk fans (who might be even angered by my reducing Berserks rich plot to pure slaughter), but a game for the general roguelike audience.

Berserk is very short in gameplay -- thus there is no saving -- mainly because the fact, that enemies will come in greater strength and numbers all the time -- in fact, there is no way to "win" the game -- just take as many of them with you to oblivion!

Fear not tough -- you won't sell your soul cheaply -- You whave an arsenal of deadly toys (though there is no inventory system at all -- only powerupish items to be used).

Considering that the game seems pretty dumb at first glance, combat needs has been made *very* tactical. I summoned for this reason a couple combat enhacements from the GenRogue combat system -- the Pain system and the Energy system, for instance.

Anyway, enough chitchat, play the game, dammit! ;]

All the help needed is available online by pressing "h". You can change the keybindings in the berserk.ini file. Also after death a file called 
"mortem.txt" is created -- you can post it on the forum or the newsgroups :)

A enhanced version may be released in the future (if enough people will be bugging me for it). Major features planned for it:

  -- A campaign mode, where you travel from battlefield to battlefield,
     gaining items, levels, and loosing your sanity
  -- character skills and advancement
  -- better AI
  -- more interesting monsters
  -- more battlefields
  -- more statistics
