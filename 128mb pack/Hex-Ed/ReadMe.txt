Welcome to Hex-Ed, the freeware Hex Editor!

Hex-Ed is a work in progress, but for this utility to improve, I need
your feedback!
You can use and distribute Hex-Ed freely, as long as you include this
text file in its original form without modifications.

Hex-Ed was written to give you complete access to binary files, and 
should always be used with caution: executing modified executables can
have unpredictable results if you're not sure what you're doing.
I can not guarantee any results: always make a back-up copy before 
modifying any file!

History
-------
Hex-Ed was originally written in BASIC on a CP/M system, but that was 
decades ago... At the time I needed a simple program to open files I 
had created in Z80 Assembler language and apply fixes without
recompiling. In those days processors were simpler and I could 
disassemble code just by looking at the hex-values!
Later I ported the code to DOS and rewrote the program in C so I could
use it at work on the Solaris systems we used.
I wrote the first Windows-version in Microsoft Visual-C for Windows 3.0
and later modified it to the current 32-bits version.

There are many versions around, mostly copies I left with friends and
colleagues, on various platforms.
To make sure you always use the most recent version, I'd like you to
send me an e-mail 'registering' your copy, so that I can notify you of
updates (don't worry, I wont sell your address, neither send you any
junk messages).

If you need any help or suggestions, you can e-mail me as well.
Whenever I find some time to work on Hex-Ed, I try to include the 
suggestions I have received to improve the program.

Using Hex-Ed from the explorer
------------------------------
You can create a shortcut to Hex-Ed in your 'Send to' - directory, so
that you can use Hex-Ed from the explorer by right-clicking on a file
and 'sending it' to Hex-Ed.
