// map:mode:muts:time:allowVote[:minplayer[:maxplayer[:skiplines]]]
// map will be skipped, if minplayer/maxplayer requirements are failed

// map: map filename without extension
//      do only use standard maps and maps from your packages/maps/servermaps folder
//      for the flag modes (5, 14 & 15), be sure, the map contains flag bases

// mode:
//        Coop-edit (1), Deathmatch (2),

// minplayer: if set, the server will skip the map, if fewer than required players are connected

// maxplayer: if set, the server will skip the map, if more than allowed players are connected

// skiplines: lines to skip in maprot.cfg, after this map got actually played
//            this can be used to select one of several lines, instead of playing all lines
