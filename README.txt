Details:

Tiny USB Office 2021: Enhanced for XP, is intended to extend, improve and update the former Tiny USB 
Office from 2008, to a “full featured” while retaining the “Fully Portable” package, using a combination 
of “Small is beautiful” and “Plus the kitchen sink” design philosophies; that being to attempt to be as 
inclusive as possible, while being respectful to disk space and resource use. 

Many tools will work on Windows 9x (Windows 95 to ME) and NT3.x/NT4.x, but the package is designed 
for Win32, or 32bit, NT5.x (or Windows 2000 and XP) forward (to Windows 10, with both 32 and 64bit 
users supported)

The original Tiny USB Office 2008 release, which itself replaced the FloppyOffice package, was an 
improved version of the small, portable productivity software suite which offers a collection of unique 
standalone free software applications. If you find yourself working on different machines and like the 
idea of having portable software that you can access hassle-free from any computer, then this is the 
package for you. 

***

Note:

The Tiny USB Office 2021: Enhanced for XP package attempts to keep size and resource use, plus 
requirements in mind. That said very few tools may require Dot Net framework and/or Java to function. 

I have tried to exclude/minimize tools that have these requirements, but a few are unavoidable, unless I 
was willing to lessen feature sets and increase space requirements heavily, and I was not. The system 
using this package may require MS “vcredist”, in 32bit, to function, but I believe Windows XP SP3 
forward include this by default.

To achieve maximum portability and reduce disk space used, all included files, when possible have been 
pruned to:

*	Single language, all additional languages for each application are available as a separate 
download via author site.

*	Minimal documentation to help/manuals only, all original documentation is available as a 
separate add-on download.

*	Audio, image and video file size and quality has been compressed to a radio/standard definition 
broadcast quality, all original files for each application are available separate download via 
author site.

*	And finally, all are Brute LZMA method, full strip, only first icon uncompressed, UPX packed. all 
original files for each application are available as a separate download via author site.

*	Sources to included files, in original state as published by author, are available as a separate 
download via author site. Links in this document, inside the application description section.
