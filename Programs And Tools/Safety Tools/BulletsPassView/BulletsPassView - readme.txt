After revealing the passwords, you can easily copy them to the clipboard or save them into text/html/csv/xml file.

- BulletsPassView also reveals the passwords stored in the password text-box of Internet Explorer. 
- BulletsPassView supports command-line options to save the current opened password boxes into text/html/csv/xml file. 
- BulletsPassView is a unicode application, which insures that passwords with non-English characters will be extracted properly.
