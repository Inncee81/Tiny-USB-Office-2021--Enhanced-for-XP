When working in the background, AviScreen will be visible as an icon on the taskbar as shown in the image below.</p><p><img border=0 src=images/Icon.png width=138 height=51></p><p>To close the application, click on the icon and click exit on the popup menu. The exit menu is also available under the main menu "Files".&nbsp;<br> <br> All AviScreen settings are contained in the settings window: visible when AviScreen is started.
