A feature that is unique to AviScreen is "follow the cursor mode". If this option is checked, the capture rectangle will follow the cursor, making it possible to cover the screen activity indicated by the cursor within a relatively small area. This makes it possible to deliver the video through a lower bandwidth. You can specify whether the cursor is visible or hidden in the capture by checking/un-checking the "show the cursor" checkbox.</p></body></html>
