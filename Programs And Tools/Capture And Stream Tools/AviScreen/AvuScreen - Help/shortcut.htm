As the AviScreen window is hidden by default these shortcut keys can be very useful. Another way of controlling activity is by using the popup menu that appears when you click the AviScreen icon on the Trackbar.</p><p>&nbsp;<img border=0 src=images/Shortcut.png width=379 height=267></p><p>The default combination keys are:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>To take an image: CTRL+X. Press the "Ctrl" key on the keyboard followed by "X" key. For some keyboards it is important to follow this sequence.&nbsp;</li> <li>To start taking video: CTRL+ALT+S: Pressing these three keys in the right sequence.&nbsp;</li> <li>To pause/continue video capture: CTRL+ALT+P&nbsp;</li> <li>To stop video capture: CTRL+ALT+F&nbsp;</li></ol><p>You can change the shortcut key combination by clicking on the "Change button". The following dialog will appear:&nbsp;</p><p><img border=0 src=images/Setkey.png width=253 height=205></p><p>Press OK button to store the new shortcut key combination.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it is possible to set the shortcut key as a single key, it is advisable to choose a combination of one or more control keys (Ctrl, Shift and Alt) with a character.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't forget to test the new customized shortcut key before using it. It is possible that the default shortcut key or the customized shortcut key that you have entered has a function in one or more of the applications you wish to capture. In this case the shortcut key will be "absorbed" by the application and may not reach AviScreen (which works in the background.) Avoid this by customizing the key to some other value.&nbsp;</p><p>On some slow machines or when the computer is very busy, the shortcut key may reach the time out before reaching AviScreen. If this happens you will need to access AviScreen through the Popup menu. Click on "Default" to restore the default shortcut keys.</p></body></html>
