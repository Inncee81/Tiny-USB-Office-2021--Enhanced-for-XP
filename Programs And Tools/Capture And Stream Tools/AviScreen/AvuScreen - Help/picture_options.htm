The settings size/mode, visibility of the cursor and "follow the cursor" mode are also applicable for image capture.&nbsp;</p><p><img border=0 src=images/PictureOption.png width=379 height=267></p><p>You can select the image saving format: either jpg, 24 bits bmp bitmap or 256 color gif. Image capture will be done individually. You need to use shortcut key "take an image" to get a picture. If you initiate the image capture through the popup menu, a delay as set by the video option will be given, so that you can put the cursor in the right position before the image is taken.&nbsp;</p><p>Single image capture is disabled when AviScreen is busy with video capture.</p></body></html>
