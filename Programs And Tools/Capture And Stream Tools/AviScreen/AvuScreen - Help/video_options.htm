When started, AviScreen will collect and list all installed VFW video codec that can be used to write a video file. Select the one to use. Video compression helps to reduce the size of the video file.</p><p>&nbsp;<img border=0 src=images/Video.png width=379 height=267></p><p>There are more than 20 different kinds of VFW codec available, either pre-installed, free download or commercial. They have different performances in speed, image quality and compression rate. Some codec are distributed freely only for playing (decompressing) video files and cannot be used to write video files. This is not always stated in advance. If this kind of codec has been selected, AviScreen will show the following message:&nbsp;</p><p><img border=0 src=images/BadCodec.png width=246 height=118></p><p>Familiarize yourself with the installed codec by doing some tests before using any codec.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also decide to not compress the video by selecting the first option. "Uncompressed 24 bit DIB" (as shown on the options image). Technically speaking, this will give the best image, since no compression will be involved. However, uncompressed video is very big compared to compressed video.&nbsp;</p><p>The frame per second figure shows the expected number of images to capture per second. The real number of frames per second (fps) may be lower if the computer is too slow to handle the task (in combination with the task requested by the application running in the foreground). Setting the fps too high will only waste the bandwidth, while setting it too low will give "jumpy" animation. Unlike "natural movies" which need at least 15 fps to appear smooth, screen video capture can appear natural with a lower fps (unless a movie playing on the screen is involved). The proposed 4 fps is rather low, but many slow computers can only reach this fps for a full screen video capture.&nbsp;</p><p>Delay before capture is the time in seconds set before the video started. This delay may be needed if you use the popup menu to control AviSreen.&nbsp;</p><p>When the video capture is about to start (after the "delay before capture" has elapsed) an animation will appear on the taskbar. The AviScreen icon will turn into a rotating wheel. As shown below</p><p>&nbsp;<img border=0 src=images/IconCap.png width=126 height=42></p><p>You can pause the video capture any time, either using the shortcut key or the popup menu. The rotating animation will turn into a blocked movement as shown below</p><p><img border=0 src=images/IconPause.png width=130 height=40></p></body></html>
