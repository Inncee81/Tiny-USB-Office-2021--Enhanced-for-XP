For image capture files, AviScreen will create a folder in the Base output folder. The name of the folder is also based on the time of creation. All images made in a session (until AviScreen is closed) will be put in this folder. The images in this folder will be named with an 8 digit index of creation (starting with B00000001.jpg and up).</p></body></html>
