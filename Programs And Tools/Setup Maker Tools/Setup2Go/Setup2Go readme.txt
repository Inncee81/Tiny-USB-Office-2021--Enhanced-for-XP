Welcome to SDS Software Setup2Go 1.9.11

What is Setup2Go?
-----------------------------
Setup2Go is a powerful, easy to use, highly interactive tool
for creating Windows based installation packages. Setup2Go
supports all 32-bit Windows versions in use today - 
Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP. Unlike other Installer
and Setup creation programs, Setup2Go is script-free and does
not require the user to have any programming background, nor
does it require the user to learn any application-specific
language! It allows you to use a point-and-click interface to
create and manage installation projects based on your business
needs. Besides that this tool will allow you to create
self-extracting executable files for distribution over the Web,
Internet, Intranet and e-mail your data files, graphic images
or whatever else you want to distribute!

System Requirements
--------------------------------
Minimal configuration:
 * Pentium 133 or higher
 * 32MB RAM
 * 800x600 screen resolution
 * Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP

Setup2Go Freeware Version 
--------------------------------
Complete version of Setup2Go with unlimited rights to produce 
setups for both commercial and freeware products. There are 
absolutely no limitations in the functionality, and none of 
those annoying "nag screens" in the main application. Setups 
producing by this version will have an advertisement page for 
SDS Software when the installation is complete.
