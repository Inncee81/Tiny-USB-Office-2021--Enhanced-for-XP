<h2>General features</h2>
<h3>The Directory Player</h3>
<p>
1by1 is a small and versatile audio player for MP3 and many more audio formats supported by the BASS
library or by plugins - as WAV, OGG, AAC, MP4, FLAC, CD. With no need for playlists it simply plays your tracks,
one by one directly from your directories.
</p><p>
The player focuses on smart file handling and enhanced play features. You won't find visual effects or skins. On the
other hand you get many extra features like audio enhancing, crossfading, file finder, Cue sheet and Playlist support.
</p>
<h3>General usage</h3>
<p>
Browse your folders using the tree and start tracks from the lists. Besides the configurable toolbar there are some
<b>menus</b> to be opened by right clicking: On the toolbar (also by F1) you reach the <b>Main menu</b> with
<b>Options menu</b>, History and Bookmarks. Track list and Tree items have <b>Context menus</b>.
</p>
<h3>Resume Play</h3>
<p>
The <b>Resume</b> function is not just a simple pause button. It remembers the played file and the position -
even when the program was closed. To resume a track, press the <b>Stop/Play</b> button or the Space key.
1by1 always starts in the previously played folder by default.
</p>
<h3>Bookmarks</h3>
<p>
You can store up to 30 tracks, folders, Cue sheets or playlists. They are shown in the <b>Main/Bookmarks
menu</b>. Under the Bookmarks item in the tree, local folders and lists are also shown. To <b>add a bookmark</b> you
have three ways: 1. track context menu, 2. tree context menu folders/lists, 3. Main menu for the current position.
</p>
<h3>Uninstall</h3>
<p>
To remove 1by1 from your system, simply delete the program folder and the shortcuts. The program does not create
any Registry entries. 1by1 tries to store its <i>ini-File</i> in the program folder. If you don't have write access there, the
settings are stored in the folder <i>1by1</i> in the user profile, usually under <i>AppData\Roaming</i>. To remove it
from there, you can easily use the <i>Uninstall...</i> function in the System section of 1by1's settings.
</p>

<a id="mov"></a>
<h2>Track handling</h2>
<h3>Moving and skipping tracks in the list</h3>
<p>
The <b>Next</b> button moves selected tracks to the position after the current. To exclude a track from being played,
press the <b>Skip</b> button, which never deletes any file but removes it temporarily from the list until it is reloaded.
Tracks can also be <b>dragged</b> with the mouse or moved with <b>Shift+(Page) Up/Down</b>. On changing or
reloading the folder, any changes will be forgotten.
</p><p>
<b>Tip:</b> To let 1by1 continue at another position, skip the current track and select the next track to be played.
</p>
<h3>Sort and shuffle files</h3>
<p>
You can sort your file list with the tab buttons. <b>Shuffle</b> (random file listing) is enabled by the <b>Shuffle button</b>
in the toolbar. To shuffle again press the same button. To leave the Shuffle mode, press one of the sort buttons.
Jumping into random directories is not possible. But you can play a <b>whole path shuffled</b> by listing subfolder
contents (see below).
</p>
<h3>Repeat modes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regular play
<li>Repeat all tracks (of the folder or the whole drive - depending on <i>Auto search dirs</i> set)
<li>Repeat the current track (works not with Cue sheets)
<li>Play only one track (works not with Cue sheets)
<li>Repeat only current track: temporary enabled until the track is changed
<li>Stop only after current track: one time usage of Play one track
</ul>
<h3>Dropping files</h3>
<p>
A single file or a group of files can be dropped into 1by1 - with different effects:
<ul>
<li>Drop to file list or playlist: Insert track(s) to list
<li>Drop to folder tree: jump to folder and start track
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Intro scan</h3>
<p>
Gives an audible overview of the tracks in the current list. Opened from the <b>Main menu</b> or by <b>Ctrl+N</b>.
It starts from the first or from the selected track and works even with Cue sheets. Scanning multiple folders is not
possible. Adjust start position and preview duration with the sliders. While Intro scan is running you have access to
the other funcrtions, e.g. to enqueue files to the playlist view.
</p>
<h3>(Auto) insert</h3>
<p>
Automated and manual insertion of tracks from another folder to the current list. Opened either by a folder context menu,
or by sending results of the <b>search dialog</b> to the Insert window. Tracks are added manually with <b>Insert</b>,
double click or by dragging. Automatic insertions will be done after a time between 1 and 90 minutes (adjusted by the
slider). The next or the first file will be inserted. Only one file can be auomatically inserted to the same position.
</p>

<a id="lis"></a>
<h2>Find and list</h2>
<h3>Directory finder</h3>
<p>
1by1 scans for folders with known file types, playlists and Cue sheets with the <b>Find previous/next folder</b> buttons.
If <i>Auto search dirs</i> is enabled, 1by1 will search the next folder when it reaches the end of the current. To skip
playlists and Cue sheets (to prevent files from being played twice), check the corresponding option in the control settings.
</p>
<h3>File finder</h3>
<p>
By <b>F3 or the tree context menu</b> you can call the file finder for a folder tree item. <b>Shift+F3 or the optional toolbar
button</b> calls the file finder for the current drive. The finder searches (always including subfolders) for files with currently
supported types. You can enter a search string (e.g. part of a track name or an extension), a date range, a size range or a
combination of all (AND combined). A running search can be interrupted by pressing the Esc key.
</p><p>
The button <b>To insert view</b> sends the results to the <i>Insert window</i> instead of the normal file list. To list all
(supported) files of the path and subfolders, press Search with nothing entered. Scanning all drives at once is not possible.
</p>
<h3>Playlists and Cue Sheets</h3>
<p>
Playlists (*.m3u, *.m3u8) and Cue Sheets (*.cue) appear <b>like folders</b> in the tree. <b>Playlists</b> can be shown
in their original order, sorted by filename or path or be shuffled. <b>Cue sheets</b> are used to display large files (e.g. CD
images) with track indices and titles. A Cue sheet can only be played in the given order.
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Cue sheets used together with <b>VBR files</b> will usually create incorrect cue positions. 1by1 can locate
the exact cue positions in VBR files with the <i>Control</i> option <b>Scan Cue sheet positions on VBR files</b>. While
scanning the VBR file for the cues, the program may freeze for a short time.
</p>
<h3>Playlist View</h3>
<p>
A second list can be opened to compile a playlist from different folders. Use the <b>Playlist button</b> in the toolbar
(or Shift+F5) to switch it on/off. If you quit 1by1 or close the list, the content will be saved.
</p><p>
To add files, simply <b>drag</b> them from the file list or press <b>Ctrl+Return</b> or choose <b>Enqueue</b>
from the file context menu. You can also enqueue a file at the command line by starting 1by1 with the option
<i>/enqueue</i> (see Command line options), or drag files from the explorer into the playlist view.
</p><p>
For adding existing <b>m3u Playlists</b> to the playlist view, copy the whole list from the normal view to the playlist
view by selecting all (Ctrl+A). If the file of a playlist entry does not exist, it will not be copied to the playlist view.
</p><p>
To <b>export tracks to a playlist file</b>, open the context menu for one or more selected files and use
<b>Playlist > Create/Append</b>". This works also in the normal file view.
</p>
</p>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>
The status bar on the bottom gives information of folder summary, track type and decoder,
and on the right side some informations about program settings in short form. These are the meanings:

<h2>Audio configuration</h2>
<h3>Settings window</h3>
<p>
The Settings window can be opened with the <b>Settings button</b>, by pressing <b>F6</b> or from the Main menu.
</p>
<h3>Audio settings</h3>
<p>
<b>Output Device:</b> Default is the default DirectSound device selected for the system. Also other available devices
can be selected. If a selected device is not available later (e.g. by plugging out a headphone), it will result in an error.
</p><p>
<b>Buffer length:</b> Size of the total audio buffer used for DirectSound and WaveOut. Default is 1 second. On play
interruptions a higher value could help.
</p><p>
<b>Alt. volume setting:</b> If (in rare cases) volume setting by the slider does not work or affects other apps, this
option can be used to calculate the volume internally. Only working on 16 bit output.
</p><p>
<b>Auto space:</b> Waits the entered time (in milliseconds) before starting the next track. Maximum is 10 seconds.
Disables the Gapless output.
</p><p>
<b>Gapless:</b> Allows continuous audio output on track changings. E.g. WAV, FLAC, CD and also MP3 files which
are directly encoded with Lame can be played with no interruptions.
</p><p>
<b>Skip silences:</b> Parts below -56 dB at track beginnings and ends will be skipped.
</p><p>
<b>Overlap mixing:</b> Automated track transition mixing. Buffer size should be large enough, 10 seconds is the
default. <b>Out: Samplerate</b> enables resampling to a fixed rate for avoiding interruptions on samplerate changes.
Recommended is <b>Out: Current track</b> to disable resampling, because the quality needs to be improved.
<b>Threshold</b> adjusts the level of the ending track where the next track sets in.
</p>
<h3>Decoders: ACM and mpglib.dll</h3>
<p>
<b>ACM</b> is the default and recommended decoder for MP3. It is part of Windows since XP.
Also <b>Wine (Linux)</b> provides an MP3 ACM, but it may return wrong "source bytes used" data causing the time
and position bar run too fast. So on Wine it is recommended to use BASS instead.
</p><p>
<b>mpglib.dll</b> uses a little more CPU than ACM or BASS. It must be in 1by1's folder. Version 0.92 is really old
(2001), but it decodes Layers 3 and also 2. It is available at 1by1's homepage. Only the binary is needed, not the
source. If you have BASS or no MP2 files, it is not needed at all.
</p>
<h3>Decoders: BASS</h3>
<p>
The BASS library decodes lots of file formats: MP3, MP2, OGG, WAV, many "trackers", and with add-ons also
AAC, MP4, MIDI, FLAC, CD-Audio and more.
</p><p>
<b>Usage:</b> Download the bass.dll and optionally some add-ons from the Un4seen homepage. Copy the
<b>DLL file(s)</b> into the 1by1 program folder. <b>IMPORTANT: Copy the 32 bit versions, NOT 64 bit!</b>
Because 1by1 is also a 32 bit application. If you want to use the Midi add-on, you also need a GM Soundfont file in the
program folder (the first found is used). All currently supported file types are shown in the lists.
The "pure" 1by1 only shows MP3 and MP2.
</p><p>
BASS also allows <b>netstreaming</b>. The URLs must be in an m3u playlist, preferably together with a "friendly"
stream name in a line above the URL (format: "#EXTINF:-1,name"). For more info check m3u format refererences
or download the Webradio m3u example from the 1by1 homepage. You can also <b>save a playing netstream:</b>
Right click on a folder in the tree and select <b>Save download stream here...</b>
</p>
<h3>Decoders: Winamp Input Plugins</h3>
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Plugin support is outdated. It's recommended to use the BASS library and BASS add-ons prior to
Winamp plugins. Since 1by1 supports only Winamp 2.x plugins, unicode filenames can't be resolved. Also problems
on play and long tracks may occur.
</p><p>
<b>Usage:</b> put the needed plugin <b>DLL files</b> (in_*.dll) into your 1by1 directory.
</p><p>
Several plugins may behave differently. <u>These plugins are successfully tested in earlier 1by1 versions:</u>
<b>in_wave</b> (2.0+2.06),
<b>in_vorbis</b> (1.13a, 1.2b19+1.32; on seek problems set the plugin priority to "normal"),
<b>in_CDReader</b> (1.95),
<b>in_mp3</b> (2.75j, 2.81b, 2.91; problems with seek on VBR files with no "TOC" in the header),
<b>in_mp3pro</b> (1.1),
<b>in_mod</b> (2.2.10b29),
<b>in_mad</b> (0.14.2b, 0.15.1b; problems with seek on CBR files; 24/32 bit output successfully tested),
<b>in_mp4</b> (2.1b; buffer size must be divisible by 4!),
<b>in_flac</b> (1.1.4).
<u>Plugins which don't use the wave output</u> are no longer supported (1by1 1.95), the behaviour is undefined.
</p>
<h3>Enhancer</h3>
<p>
The built in DSP gets rid of tracks in different volumes. Depending on the settings and the input it also can enhance
the sound of tracks which already have full level. Note: The enhancer works <b>only with 16 bit</b> output.
</p><p>
<b>Max amp:</b> Maximum amplification (up to 20 dB = 10x)
</p><p>
<b>Amp raise:</b> Time the enhancer tends towards the maximum amplification level. A shorter value will enhance
more but can also cause more distortions on some input material. For more original sound choose longer values
(500 ms or more), to enhance the presence try shorter values (130...80 ms).
</p><p>
<b>Amp reduce:</b> Amplification reducing speed on exceeding the threshold. To minimize distortions it must not be
too slow but even not too fast. Recommended values are from 0.6 ms to 1.0 ms.
</p><p>
<b>Threshold:</b> A value of about -3 dB is recommended. This is the "headroom" to catch distortions
if "Amp reduce" does not react fast enough. The output level is not generally limited to the threshold.
</p><p>
<b>Input HP cutoff:</b> Using a highpassed "side chain" signal to reduce a "pumping" output. May create
bass distortions especially on values above 80 Hz. Then also lowering the Threshold can help.
</p><p>
<b>Prelisten mode:</b> Only enabled while play. It switches to a short buffer to give a fast adjustment response.
</p><p>
<b>3 Band Equalizer:</b> In the frequency fields you can set individual frequencies (parametric EQ). The default
values are: 100 Hz, 1000 Hz, 10000 Hz. Works only on 16 bit output. Sliders on 0 dB don't not use CPU.
</p>
<h3>Enhancer 2 - Multiband</h3>
<p>
Multiband enhancing can produce more consistent sound of different sources. Like an "automatic equalizer" it
regulates frequency bands dynamically to a threshold. Adjustments should be careful. More garbage is possible
- but also a more present and smoother sound.
</p><p>
Up to four bands are possible. If a crossover frequency is set to 0, the next bands are disabled. <b>Threshold</b>
is the most important value for the appearance of each band. Higher frequencies usually have a lower level in order
not to overshade the mix. The curve on the right shows a frequency chirp, it is not aligned by the frequencies.
</p><p>
<b>Level</b> adjusts the level after Multiband and before Soft clipping and Limiter. <b>Stereo</b> reaches from a
40 % mono mix to 40 % channel separation. <b>Soft clipping</b> is a simple algorithm to smooth distortions of audio
clipping. It can also produce a bit of wanted saturation. If disabled, the Limiter catches clippings.
</p>

<a id="opt"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous settings</h2>
<h3>Control options</h3>
<p>
<b>Continue in focused list:</b> Can be used if the paylist view is open. Means that the next track
will be taken from the current position or selection of the current/focused list. The focused list
can be slightly hilited by an option in the List settings. Without this option checked, the list focus
will be ignored and 1by1 continues playing the list where the current file was started.
</p><p>
<b>Go home before track change:</b> Returns to the folder of the current file before starting the
next track. This option prevents from playing unwanted tracks on browsing through other folders.
</p>
<h3>List options</h3>
<p>
<b>Folders and lists in file view:</b> Shows subdirectories, playlists and Cue sheets of the current
folder at the top of the file list. Useful for navigating without the folder tree.
</p><p>
<b>File info in context menu:</b> Displays audio parameters, length and ID3v1 fields of the
selected file directly at the top of the context menu.
</p><p>
<b>Show created instead of modified date:</b> Disabled by default. If enabled, the last row of the file list
shows the creation date of a file instead of the date of the last modification. For normal usage this should
be disabled. The creation date of a copied file is newer than its modified date.
This option also affects the features File finder and Easy renamer.
</p><p>
<b>Allow sort by month:</b> Gives you an additional sort option in the date row, which sorts the list
at first by month and then by year.
</p><p>
<b>Month colors:</b> This feature visualizes the date of your tracks. It associates a color range to the
12 months of the year, giving an overview of the seasons the files are dated.
</p>
<h3>Display options</h3>
<p>
<b>Show track/folder related pictures:</b> This feature shows images (e.g. cover art) in the lower left corner.
It looks for <b>two types of picture names</b> in the current directory: either a picture which <b>filename beginning</b>
fits to the current track (e.g.: <i>"album5.jpg"</i> for the tracks <i>"album5_track1.mp3", "album5_track2.mp3"</i>...)
- or, if no track related picture is found, an editable standard filename as <i>"folder.jpg"</i>. If a picture is found in an
<b>ID3v2 tag</b>, 1by1 will use it before looking for track related picture files. With <b>embedded Big title view</b>,
the picture is shown on the right and always track related or ID3v2 if present. If the image is placed below the tree view,
it shows the folder picture file of the currently browsed folder if present.
</p><p>
<b>On no present image...:</b> If the picture function does not find any picture, this option allows to fill the place
with a standard image. It must have the standard filename and must be stored in the 1by1 settings folder
(which can be reached easily by the corresponding button in the Control tab).
</p><p>
<b>Bitmap file for the toolbar buttons:</b> Lets you select an external image file for individual toolbar
styles. The BMP file must be a row of 21 images of the same size. Its color depth should be 4 or 8 bit
(16 or 256 colors). The color of the first pixel will be interpreted as the transparent color. As 1by1 saves
not the path of the BMP file, it must be in the program directory.
</p>
<h3>System options</h3>
<p>
<b>External Programs:</b> Allows starting other programs by the context menu of a selected file,
folder, playlist or Cue sheet. If you want to start an external program with <b>additional parameters</b>,
you should create a <b>batch file</b> and set it as the external program instead of the program itself.
<b>Example:</b> for calling the Lame encoder from 1by1 create a file <i>"Lame.bat"</i> containing
a line like <i>"C:\Windows\Lame.exe -m j -q 1 -b 128 %1"</i>, where %1 is the placeholder for the file
to be sent to the external program.
</p><p>
<b>High Priority:</b> Disabled by default. Only recommended if other applications interfere with 1by1
and increasing the buffer size and amount on WaveOut or the buffer time on Direct Sound does not help.
</p><p>
<b>Force portable/local settings:</b> This option creates an additional ini file in the program folder. The extra
file is needed to tell the program, where to look for the normal settings file. If the 1by1local.ini file is present,
1by1 will never write or read settings to or from the user profile (like on the command line option /localini).
The option is not usable on missing write access to the program folder.
</p>
<h3>Big view</h3>
<p>
1by1 shows title, track and other informations in a big text style. The view can either be embedded in the main window
- below or above the lists. Or it can appear in an extra window - optionally after an individual input idle time.
The <b>font size</b> depends on the size of the Big view area and the number of lines (Layout). The view can be
switched manually from the main menu or by the shortcut <b>Ctrl+B</b>.
</p><p>
Bis view is configured in the <b>Big view tab</b> in the settings. Sizes are adjusted by draggings the edges. If the
undocked view moves out of screen for some reason, you can restore the position with <b>Reset view position</b>.
</p><p>
<b>Extra infos:</b> Frequently shows additional pages about program and play settings or track and output parameters.
The period of a page is adjusted with <b>Speed/Info cycle time</b>. <b>Info pattern</b> defines type and order of infos.
The help window can stay open while editing.
</p><p>
<b>RSS feed titles:</b> Adds news headlines or other RSS feed information. Put source links into the URLs field,
separated by space. If you are connected by proxy, the proxy address can be added in the system tab. The complete
RSS download can be read with <b>View RSS file</b> from the context menu (right button).
</p><p>
<b>Idle seconds until popup</b>: Mouse or keyboard idle time for appearance of the undocked Big view. Auto popup
works only if 1by1 is in foreground.

<h2>Enhanced features</h2>
<h3>Systray Icon</h3>
<p>
<b>Enable or disable</b> under Settings > System > Environment.
</p><p>
<b>Left mouse button</b>: Shows or hides the main window.
</p><p>
<b>Middle mouse button</b>: Stop / Resume
</p><p>
<b>Right mouse button</b>: Shows the tray menu with play and config options. The <b>Current list</b>
item shows the first 150 tracks of the current folder or playlist, sorted in the order of the window list.
</p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
The log file stores informations about played tracks. You can view the content
by calling <b>View track log</b> from the main menu. The log file is needed
for retrying scrobbling if a connection error has occured. If a title has been scrobbled successfully,
the last column in the log view shows 'done'. If the transfer failed, it shows 'tried'. You can also use
the track log to browse played tracks and restart them by double clicking or call other functions with
the right mouse button.
</p><p>
<b>Scrobbling</b> has been disabled in 1.86 since last.fm changed the track info submission protocol to
"API 2.0" where authentication by API key is needed. Receiving an API key for 1by1 was not working
due to relaunch problems of the last.fm site.
</p>
<h3>WAV file conversion</h3>
<p>
Tracks to be decoded by ACM, mpglib or BASS can also be saved to uncompressed WAV files (16 bit).
The function can be found in the track context menu if 1by1 is not playing anything.
In the dialog you can adjust name and location of the destination file. You also can apply
audio processing with the current settings for enhancer, equalizer and mono downmix.
</p>
<h3>HTTP web and streaming server</h3>
<p>
The HTTP server feature allows to control 1by1 by a simple remote web interface. The streaming server sends
the audio output of 1by1 in a configurable MP3 format to connected receivers.
</p><p>
To enable the HTTP server, enter the <b>local IP address of the computer</b> which runs 1by1 into the
<b>Server address</b> field. Usually you can use the local address shown on the right in the dialog (while the
server is not running). Also the port number is needed, for HTTP this usually is 80 or 8080. See the example string
in the config window on the right. After enabling/starting the server, the <b>Firewall</b> of your system may ask for
permission. You need either to allow 1by1 or the port used. With the entered server <i>address:port</i>
of the above field you can access the simple web interface from any browser in the (local) network.
</p><p>
The MP3 <b>streaming URL</b> has the format <i>http://your-ip:port/1by1.mp3</i>. Give this URL to your remote player
device. You can also use an M3U playlist. Both can be found on bottom of the web interface page. Streaming starts
if 1by1 is playing and a client requests the MP3 URL. If 1by1 is not playing and a client starts streaming, 1by1
should automatically resume the current track.
</p><p>
While not streaming, you can adjust the encoder settings
and select the encoder. Note that Lame's lame_enc.dll must be in the path or in the 1by1 program folder. For
ACM the "professional" version (l3codecp) should be used. Newer Windows versions should have it already,
but it may be needed to activate by adding a few Registry entries.
</p><p>
The option <b>Keep connection and send silence</b> allows streaming even if 1by1 is not playing. This may also be
needed if Gapless play is not used. Otherwise an interruption of the stream may occur on track changes.
</p>
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Streaming of a running audio output is a quite complex matter of moving, handling, compressing
and sending audio segments. Stream terminations, sound interruptions or skippings may occur.
Depending on the device, WaveOut method for local audio output might
give a little more stable results than DirectSound.

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p><b>How can I play MP4, AAC, WAV, OGG, FLAC, CD...?</b><br>
By using the BASS library or a plugin. More infos under <a href="#aud">Audio config</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Which plugin plays exotic formats?</b><br>
Known informations are collected in the Plugin section (<a href="#aud">Configuration</a>).
</p>
<p><b>The volume fader does not work or affects other programs.</b><br>
Activate 1by1's internal volume adjustment: Settings / Audio / Alternative volume setting.
</p>
<p><b>1by1 in background plays interrupted.</b><br>
In the Audio settings switch to a Direct Sound output device (usually to the first list item beginning with "DirectSound:").
The "High task priority" option in Settings / System could also help.
</p>
<p><b>Can 1by1 show ID3 Tag informations in the list?</b><br>
Scannable informations like titles can be shown in an extra column. This is enabled under "List and Tree".
ID3 fields are also shown in the track info dialog (Context menu or Alt+Return or Ctrl+I) and in the Big title view.
</p>
<p><b>How can I shuffle multiple folders at once?</b><br>
Random play is only possible for the current list. But you can fill the list with all tracks within a path by calling
"Show subfolder contents" in the tree context menu. The result can be shuffled or sorted as known.
</p>
<p><b>Network or desktop folders do not work correctly.</b><br>
The complete network structure is only shown on browsing the network. To display an existing track path in the
network, 1by1 will add the single <i>\\server\sharepoint\</i> part under the network item.
</p>
<p><b>Can 1by1 support multiple languages?</b><br>
Language support is not planned. The program and all documentations will only be provided in english.
</p>
<p><b>How can I make 1by1 portable?</b><br>
Easiest way is the "Force portable/local settings" option under Settings / System /  "Configuration files". Also without
this option 1by1 is already portable if: 1. the program folder has write access for the ini, 2. there is no 1by1 folder in
the user profile. 1by1 will only store the settings in the user profile on missing write access to its own folder. Once the
settings are in the user profile, this location will be used. Portable usage can also be forced by the "/localini" command
line option. To prevent starting in the last folder, check Settings / Control "Start in Base folder".
