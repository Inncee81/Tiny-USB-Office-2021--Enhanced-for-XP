		<div class="heading">Overview</div>
		The scheduler is an experimental feature recently added to i.Ftp to let you schedule download to
		start at a given time. Useful for transfering large files at off peck times. i.Ftp must
		remain running, but idle for the scheduler to work. Because of the beta status of the feature
		don't rely on it for anything important, feadback about the operation of the scheduler would
		be appreciated.
		<p/>

		<div class="heading">Download Manager</div>
		To create a scheduled download, open the schedule manager using the Schedule->Schedule Downloads
		menu. The manager is a simple list of scheduled downloads. To create a new schedule click the
		"+" button. To delete a download, select it in the list and click "-". To edit an existing download
		double click the list entry.
		<p/>

		<div class="heading">Scheduling A Download</div>
		The scheduled download form lets you set the date and time for the download to start and of course
		the URL of the file to download. Paste/type the full ftp://... URL of the file to download
		into the URL field. To set the date click the first drop down to the right of the Time field and
		navigate to the date. To set the time for the download click the next drop down beside the date
		dropdown. Finally select a local folder to download the file to, use the "..." for a selection
		dialog, or just paste/type the folder name into the field.
