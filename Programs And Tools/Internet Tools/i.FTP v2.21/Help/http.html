		<div class="heading">Overview</div>
		The HTTP downloader in i.Ftp is a simple one shot affair primarily useful for having more control over the
		proxy and caching settings than you would get with a normal browser. You also have access to all the headers
		sent back by the server, which is useful for web developers. It supports resuming downloads which most
		browsers don't do, useful for large file downloads that broke connection. The HTTP downloader can not be
		active while an FTP connection is currently open.
		<p/>

		<div class="heading">Usage</div>
		Open the HTTP downloader via the HTTP->HTTP Download menu, then fill out the relevant fields.
		<blockquote>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td class="fld">URL
					<td>The full URL of the file to download.
				<tr>
					<td class="fld">File
					<td>The local file to download to. If you have set the URL field already and you click the
					"..." button you will have the filename pre-populated and all you have to do is select the
					right folder.
				<tr>
					<td class="fld">Use Proxy
					<td>The proxy fields are for specifying the HTTP proxy server to use. The username / password
					fields are optional, some proxy servers don't need them. Currently the HTTP download doesn't
					support user authentication, this is not the place to put any username/password required to
					access the source file, but the auth for the proxy.
				<tr>
					<td class="fld">Resume Download
					<td>The resume options control the operation of the resume download feature. If the download
					file already exists but is of a smaller size than the source file on the HTTP server you can
					resume the download to only fetch the part of the file you don't have. Note: Some servers don't support
					resuming downloads. The option "Roll Back" allows you to discard the last "n" KB of the file as possibly
					corrupt. This is useful for modem connects where you were downloading the connection dropped out. This
					can corrupt the end of the file. A value of 8 to 16 is useful in this case. However most of the time
					this roll back is not needed.
				<tr>
					<td class="fld">Force Cache to Refetch
					<td>This option turns on the header that askes the HTTP proxy cache to refetch the document/file
					regardless of whether it's out of date or not. Useful if you getting an old version of the file.
			</table>
