<p><b>Cutting a Video Track</b><br>
<br>
After adding a video track, you can cut it to change its starting and/or ending point.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="images/AVideo.JPG" width="462" height="94"><br>
<br>
Play through the video to locate the starting point of the shot or sequence you want. Stop. (More information about
<a href="timeline_controls_1.htm"> Timeline controls</a>)<br>
<br>
Right-click in the orange video bar at the point you have located.<br>
<br>
Choose “Mark-in and Mark-out” in the pop up menu.<br>
<br>
Select “Mark-in”.<br>
<br>
If you wish to change the ending point of the shot or sequence, repeat this procedure choosing “Mark-out”.<br>
<br>
To release Mark-in or Mark-out points and return to the original starting and/or ending points, right-click in the orange video bar, select “Mark-in and Mark-out” and choose the appropriate release.<br>
<br>
PLEASE NOTE: This cutting method can only extract one shot or sequence from one video file. This is not a problem. If you want another shot or sequence from the same video file, simply
<a href="addingVideoTrack.htm"> add the video file again</a> and repeat the process. You can do this as often as you like.</p>
