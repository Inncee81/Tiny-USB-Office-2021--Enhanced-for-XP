<p><b>Timeline Controls I</b><br>
<br>
The simplest way to work with AviTricks is to use the Timeline. This is the light green area under the preview screen. The film you are working on is represented on the Timeline by a dark green line. The video track appears as an orange bar which is split into the different files that have been added. Special effects appear as pink blocks under the orange bar.<br>

<br>
At the top left of the Timeline two buttons allow you to switch between two editing modes. Arrange Mode (default) allows you to add or size video tracks, special effects or other elements. Adjust or

allows you to adjust the settings of a selected object.<br>
<br>
To the right of these editing mode selectors are Play, Stop and Go To controls.<br>
<br>
Next to these we find the Add Video and Add Effect buttons.<br>
