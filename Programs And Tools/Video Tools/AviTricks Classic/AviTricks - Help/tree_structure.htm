<p><b>Tree Structure</b><br>
<br>
The Tree Structure, located to the left of the Timeline, is a graphic representation of your project, showing different pieces of video footage, the effects you have added and the relationships between them.
</p>

<br>
Besides representing the relationship between the elements of the film you are making, the Tree Structure also allows you to change the relationships between these elements, either by clicking and dragging them up or down the Tree Structure, or by selecting an element and using the up/down arrows on the right of the Tree Structure.<br>
<br>
For video footage, groups and subprojects, the vertical position represents order or sequence. If you move a piece of video down the tree, it will appear later in the film.<br>
<br>
For special effects, filters and so on, the vertical position represents order of application. This becomes important when two or more effects are being applied simultaneously. In that case the order of application can affect the appearance of the final image. (See:
<a href="Layering%20Effects.htm"> AviTricks Basics: Layering Effects</a> ) The highest effect will be applied first, the lowest will be applied last. Click and drag, or select and use the arrows to change their position in the Tree Structure.<br>
<br>
Immediately above the Tree Structure there is a row of project related buttons.<br>
