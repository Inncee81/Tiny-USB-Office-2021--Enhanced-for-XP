<p><b>AviTricks Basics: Rubber-band Adjustment</b><br>
<br>
AviTricks uses “rubber-band adjustment” – an easy way to adjust the levels of selected features, fading effects in or out, or intensifying them at key moments.<br>
	Rubber-band adjustment is activated when AviTricks is set to “Adjust” editing mode.<br>
To use rubber-band adjustment, left-click on an adjustable block. This can be either the orange video bar or a pink effect bar (please note: not all effects are adjustable). The bar you have clicked on will expand if it is adjustable.<br>
To explain the system, we will take the example of an orange video bar. Choose Adjust editing mode. Left-click on the orange video bar. It will expand. The rubber-band adjustment bar will open with one default node at the midpoint on the left. The right end of the bar is trailing, the level has not yet been fixed by adding a node.<br>

<br>
There are two adjustable features. Audio volume and balance. The first to appear is “audio volume”. (The name of the adjustable feature appears in a dropdown at the top of the Timeline.) The audio volume setting appears as a red line in the middle of the orange video bar. To adjust the volume level, double-click on this red line. A round adjustment node will appear.
Drag this node up or down to change the volume setting at that point in the video. The red line acts like a rubber band that stretches between different nodes. This makes it easy to fade effects in and out.<br>

<br>
Moving a node up increases the intensity of an effect. Moving it down decreases intensity.<br>
<br>
As a node is fixed to frame or time setting, you can only move it up or down.&nbsp;Horizontal
movement is not possible.<br>
<br>
You can create as many nodes as you like. The active node is light blue.<br>
<br>
If there is more than one adjustable feature in a particular object, you can change between the features using the dropdown in the top row of the Timeline.<br>
<br>
Please note: not all adjustable features work with a range of values, some features switch between absolute values rather than intensity. These nodes appear as squares and cannot be dragged up and down.<br>
