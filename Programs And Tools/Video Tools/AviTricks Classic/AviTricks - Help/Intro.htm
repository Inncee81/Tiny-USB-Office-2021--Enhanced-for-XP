<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
<br>
AviTricks is a powerful but easy-to-use video editing program for .<a href="Terms.htm">AVI</a>
or
<a href="Terms.htm"> Windows Media Format</a>.<br>
<br>
It makes it easy to add, cut and join video footage and includes a wide range of effects that are fully adjustable and can be used separately or in
combination (layered) .<br>
<br>
The video you are working on appears on a real-time preview screen, and is represented clearly and graphically on both a timeline and a tree-structure. Both of these fields are active and easy to work.<br>
<br>
The tree-structure and sub-project approach allows an unlimited combination of filters, effects and overlays, and makes it easy to stack new properties or split large projects into workable units that can be combined at will or farmed out to different users for a joint venture.<br>
<br>
Even video-editing novices can produce professional results with AviTricks.</p>
