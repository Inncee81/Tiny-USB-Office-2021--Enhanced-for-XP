<p><b>Color Settings</b><br>
<br>
These instructions refer to the default interface colors. We advise users to get to know the program first before customizing the interface colors. But once users are familiar with the basic controls, they can use color settings to help organize their project by color-coding video files or special effects.<br>
<br>
Choose Arrange editing mode.<br>
<br>
Right-click in the video or effect bar you wish to color code.<br>
<br>
Choose “Settings” and then “Set track color”.</p>
