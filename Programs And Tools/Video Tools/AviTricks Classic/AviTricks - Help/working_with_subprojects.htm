<p><b>Working with Subprojects</b><br>
<br>
AviTricks allows you to add an AviTricks project to another project (.mpr). It is added as a subproject.<br>
<br>
Working with subprojects allows you to divide a large project into smaller units or collaborate with other people. (Remember that an AviTricks project only contains references to the location of video and audio material, and will only work when this material can be found at that location. See AviTricks
basics: <a href="LocationSource.htm">location of material.</a>) The subproject is sealed and cannot be altered. This is represented by its being contained in a red box on the tree structure.<br>
<br>
If you want to change a subproject, you need to open it as a separate project, change it, save and close it and then return to the project in which you are using it as a subproject.<br>
<br>
If you want to apply an effect to a subproject, you can do this by applying the effect at a higher level. For instance, at the project level.
Or at the level of a group containing the subproject.<br>
