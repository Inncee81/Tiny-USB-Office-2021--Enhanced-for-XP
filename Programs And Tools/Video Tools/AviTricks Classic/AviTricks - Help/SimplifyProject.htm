<p><b>AviTricks basics: Simplifying your Project</b><br>
<br>
AviTricks allows you to attach your special effects to the “parent” of your choice. This can be a video file, a video track or another special effect.
If your film has the structure of a music clip, the sound track is the
&quot;parent&quot; and you add video as an effect.</p>

<p>When you add your first video shots to a new project, they will be represented in the orange video bar as separate entities with black lines or “splices” between them. This makes it easy to cut or delete files or to change the sequence. But when you add an effect to one of the video files, it will not cross this black line or “splice”. To work on the video track as a whole, you need to simplify or consolidate it first. You can do this by using it either as a group or a sub-project.</p>
