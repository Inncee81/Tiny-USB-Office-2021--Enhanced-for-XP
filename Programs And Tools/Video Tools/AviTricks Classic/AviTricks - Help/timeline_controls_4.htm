<p><b>Timeline controls IV</b></p>
<p>Setting and changing the starting and ending points of a time-track (mark-in and mark-out)
dominates the
whole process of video editing. AviTricks is optimized for this
task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changing or setting mark-in and mark-out&nbsp; is only available under <a href="timeline_controls_1.htm">Arrange
mode</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>First Method</b>: Using pegs.</p>

<p>Pegs are two points that designate the range over which an effect will be
added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Double-click on the bar to add a peg. Since only two pegs can appear on one
bar at a time, a prompt may appear asking the user to first confirm the removal of existing pegs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pegs may be removed from a bar through popup menu &quot;Peg\Clear pegs&quot;.
Another method to remove a peg is by double-clicking on it.</p>

<p>When a bar has a pair of pegs, an effect added to this bar will begin and end
(mark-in and mark-out) according to the position of the pegs.</p>

<p><b>Second Method</b>: Using left mouse in combination with [Ctrl] key.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Effect_resize.JPG" width="277" height="74" ></p>

<p> To shift the starting point of an effect, point the mouse at the starting point of the effect while pressing the [Ctrl] key. </p>

<p> To shift the end point of an effect, point the mouse at the end point
of the effect while pressing the [Ctrl] key. </p>

<p> To shift the effect without changing its duration, point the mouse to the
middle of the bar while pressing the [Ctrl] key.</p>

<p> <b>Third method</b>: Using the popup menu. </p>

<p> <img border="0" src="images/Mark_menu.JPG" width="326" height="258"> </p>

<p> Right-click with the mouse on the point (inside the bar) where the mark-in
should take place. Move the mouse slowly to menu &quot;Mark-in and
Mark-out&quot;, and then on to &quot;Set as Mark-in point&quot;. Click there.
Repeat this process to set the mark-out point. </p>

<p> You can release a mark-in point using &quot;Release Mark-in point&quot;.
This menu will be disabled when no Mark-in point is set for this effect. When the
Mark-in has been released, the effect will start at the starting point of its
parent. Using &quot;Release the mark-in&quot; is faster than dragging it using the
Second method mentioned above. </p>

<p> <b>Fourth Method: </b>Using viewer for marking. </p>

<p> This feature is accessible through the popup-menu, deep under&nbsp;
&quot;Mark-in and Mark-out&quot; and only relevant to a video.&nbsp; </p>

<p> <img border="0" src="images/Movie_Marker.JPG" width="616" height="199"> </p>

<p>Using the viewer you can set the mark-in and mark-out visually. To set the
Mark-in, drag the tracker to the position that you want, then click the button
with the red exclamation mark inside the &quot;Custom start box&quot;. </p>
<p>To review the settings, press &quot;locate&quot; button at any time.</p>
