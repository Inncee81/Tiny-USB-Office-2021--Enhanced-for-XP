<p><b>Adding Effects</b><br>
<br>
Once you have added a video file you can modify it by adding special effects. Special effects can be added to either a whole video file or to a set time rage within a video file. Effects can also be added to other effects, effectively stacking them to give a layered effect.<br>
<br>
To add an effect over the entire length of a video file.<br>
<br>
Go to Arrange editing mode. Make sure that time pegs have not been set inside the orange video bar on the Timeline.<br>
<br>
1/. Click “Add effect”.<br>
<br>
2/. A message about how to set a time range will appear. Since you want to add an effect over the entire length of the video file, ignore this by clicking “OK”.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3/. Choose the effect you wish to add from “Root”, “Overlay” or “Filters”. (For some effects, a preview is available.)<br>
<br>
4/. Click “OK” (2 x).<br>
<br>
The effect will appear on the Timeline as a pink bar under the orange video bar. You can now adjust the settings of the effect.<br>
<br>

<br>
An effect can also be added to or stacked on another effect. To do this click in the pink special effect bar first and then repeat the above process.</p>
