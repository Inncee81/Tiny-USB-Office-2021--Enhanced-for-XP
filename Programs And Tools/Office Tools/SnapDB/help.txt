Export:
    Snap DB has an export feature that will allow you to export the current
    view to an external file.  The way this works is that Snap DB will create
    a temporary CSV file of the current data view and then use that filepath
    as an argument for your script file.  Within your script file, it's up to
    you to take that filepath and read in the file contents.  After that, of
    course, you can do whatever your script language will allow with the data.
    Your file can be a script, executable or anything that can accept a
    filepath as an incoming argument.
    
    If you extracted the Snap DB zip properly, an export folder should have    
    been created for you.  This folder contains example export file written
    in AutoHotkey to get you started.  You are not, however, limited to
    AutoHotkey.  You can use any language that can accept a filepath as an
    argument.  If you don't have the export folder, do the following:
    
    1) Create a folder named "export" (without quotes) in your Snap DB install
       folder.
    2) Add your scripts/exes to this folder and restart Snap DB.
    3) You will now see a new entry under the File menu called "Export to..."
    4) Simply choose one of your scripts/exes in the submenu to send the
       current data view to that file.
       
    You can do just about anything you want within your scripting language.
    For instance, I use this functionality to format my video games database
    into an HTML table and then automatically upload that file to my webserver.
