version 1.0.4.0

fied inside "Contacts manager". Replaced the "PadFile Infos" MessageBox by a
cosy dialog box. Fixed a bug where the program, when iconised in the system 
tray and then closed with the "Sticky" option active, would start up the next
time at wrong onscreen coordinates, falling into a loop eating up 100% of the
CPU cycles. Added the "Topmost" option to the configuration file.

--(updated 07th june 2015)--
1st Stable release using Zlib
- StackNotes now use the CAB10.dll ! Which means that the program supports Zlib 
compression and decompression, thanks goodness, this way we get rid of the size 
problem caused by the datafiles (50 pages of 32kb = 1.5 Mb). Basically, it's 
just a ZIP container for the padfiles, which reduces their size to nearly 
nothing. Great !!! - added support for dropped files; drag a StackNotes padfile 
("*.STZ") to its table to open it on the fly. Do the same with an ascii text 
file onto its memofield to quickly add text to the padfile in use. - redone 
keyboard accelerators for a more intuitive navigation and removed an annoying 
bug due to the getasynckeystate api call. - fixed a nasty bug in the "Save As" 
function and tracked down a flickering display bug.
