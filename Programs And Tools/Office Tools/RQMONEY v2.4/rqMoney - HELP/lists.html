		<h4>PERSONS</h4>
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">F12</span></div>
		A <strong>required</strong> Transaction field with no limit to the number of persons on the list. This list records the names of all the individuals who use the database. A listed Person must be assigned to each new Transaction.<br />
          <strong>WARNING</strong>: Deleting a person from the list also deletes all transactions (revenue, expenditure and transfer), which were assigned in the database to that person.

		<!-- KATEGÓRIE -->

		<h4>CATEGORIES</h4>
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">F11</span></div>
		A <strong>required</strong> transaction field with no limit to the number of categories/subcategories on the list.<br />
    The Category field dropdown box facilitates the entry of revenue and expenditure transactions by category. If, for example. you use a car, just create a category names "car" and the relevant subcategories (eg. petrol, servicing and repair, insurance, etc.).The order of sorting records in the box is the following.:<br />
	THE ORDER-THE MOVEMENT-CATEGORY-SUBCATEGORY.<br />
	The order is used for prioritize the most frequently used entries on top. If you leave the order everywhere the same, it will be shifting records alphabetically ... (thus the first MOVEMENT, then the CATEGORY and at the end of SUBCATEGORY). It is up to you how much detail you assign to your category and the subcategories.<br />
    <strong>WARNING:</strong> Deleting the category will delete all the transactions (revenue, expenditure and movements), which are in the database assigned to it.

		<h4>ACCOUNTS</h4>
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">F10</span></div>
		 A <strong>required</strong> transaction field with no limit to number of accounts on the list. This List records all the accounts covered by the database. Each account can be of any currency but it is not possible to have multiple currencies in one account.<br />
    At the start of a new database you should assign a minimum of 2 accounts (eg. Cash and a BANK ACCOUNT). You can specify the opening balance of the account. The Date of establishment of the account is required to check against the date of the Transaction entry. The program will not allow the writing of transaction (income, expenditure or movement), where that date is older than the date of establishment of the account.<br />
    <strong>WARNING: </strong>Deleting the account will delete all the transactions (revenue, expenditure and movements), which are in the database assigned to it.

    For each currency there is sub list of all the notes and coins. As long as they are entered in the register, it is possible to easily count your cash in that currency by using the Cash Counter feature.<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to DELETE a currency only if it is not used in any account. In the event that you have established an account in that currency, the currency cannot be deleted.

<div class="ramik">
		<h4>EXTERNAL LINKS</h4>
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">F4</span></div>
		The list is used to register internet links, which will serve the user eg. for a quick connection to the bank (eg for account statements), the central national bank (due to exchange rate difference), but the user can put any links to favorite sites there. The advantage is usage of own keyboard shortcuts so after pressing them, the user automatically opens the web browser with the page.
