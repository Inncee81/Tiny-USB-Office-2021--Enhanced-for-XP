		<h4>PERIODIC TRANSACTION SCHEDULING AND REMINDERS</h4>
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">CTRL</span> <span class="key">S</span></div>
		Use the Scheduler Form to plan periodic transactions (revenue, expenditure or transfers) or to remind you to enter an important one time transaction.

To do so, click on the "Show Schedular" Icon on the toolbar to bring up the Scheduling Form, click Add and then pre enter the transaction's details and it's periodicity. This form contains two extra fields:<br />

<strong>1. Interval:</strong> You can choose from the following:<br />
<ul class="a1">
	<li>daily</li>
	<li>weekly</li>
	<li>biweekly (every two weeks)</li>
	<li>monthly</li>
	<li>quarterly</li>
	<li>half-yearly</li>
	<li>annually</li>
	<li>one time payment</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. Duration:</strong> Enter the "actual" date of the first transaction in the "From" Date but the "To" date can be actual or slightly later than the schedule's end.
Opening the program on or after the scheduled dates causes the transactions reminder to display on the "start up" screen. Now you can "write" the displayed transactions to the register.<br /> <hr>

		<strong>ADD THE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS</strong><br />
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">INSERT</span></div>
		o Add a new scheduled payment, enter the Scheduler form and fill in all normal transaction fields and the periodic "intervals" and schedule "duration". The program then generates and displays all the planned transactions on the right hand side of the form. There you can add, correct, or delete, any of the  generated transactions. <br />
You can also convert any "entered" transaction to a "recurring" one by right clicking on the transaction then selecting "set as a new scheduled item" from the resultant context menu.<br /> <hr>

		<strong>EDITING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS</strong><br />
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">ENTER</span></div>
		Open the "Transaction writing" form and select those to be immediately edited / registered. During writing the scheduled transaction most but not all fields are editable. It is not possible to correct the periodicity interval and the from-to Duration dates. If you change the amount, it will automatically be changed for that transaction's remaining future entries.<br />
If and when you want to extend the duration of a scheduled transaction item, right click on that item to bring up the "scheduled payments list", select "Add" and enter the desired new "end date".<br /> <hr>

		<strong>DELETE THE SCHEDULED PAYMENT</strong><br />
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">DELETE</span></div>
		The scheduler module stores all the generated transactions. If you need to delete some but not all, open the list of generated transactions and delete only those required.<br /><br />
IMPORTANT NOTE!!!<br />After editing or deletion of the scheduled records it is not possible to undo these steps. Deletion of an item from the schedule list will not effect its previously written transactions.<br />

		<h4>WRITING (REGISTERING) SCHEDULED</h4>
        <div class="keys"><span class="key">CTRL</span> <span class="key">Y</span></div>
		Whenever you open a database, the program checks whether there are any transactions planned for today's date or earlier planned transactions that have not yet been written to the Register. If any are found, it will display these transactions. You can then choose whether to write all or just some by unchecking those you do not want to write. Those remaining will remind you every time the database id opened, unless either written or deleted.<br />
Before writing you can edit the date or amount fields of a scheduled transaction.<br /><br />

In the program Settings, you can set the "Show scheduled Transactions for the Next X weeks. Setting this to eg. 6 weeks causes the reminder to include all scheduled transactions for the next 6 weeks. If you chose to write them you can view your account balances up to six weeks ahead.
