<h1>EVE Embedded Vector Editor</h1>
<p>EVE is true freeware. No nag screens, no limitations, no timeout.</p>

<p>NO installation required. Just double-click on "eve.exe" and open the demo diagram. Create a shortcut on your desktop 
if required.</p>
<p>To uninstall, simply delete the files. EVE does not make any changes to your operating system or PC in any way.</p>
<p>Highly recommended: go to the EVE website for latest version, extensive online documentation, and application libraries:</p>

<p>HINT:<br>
When you first start EVE, she looks real plain, as there are no fancy icons,
no toolboxes, nothing at all cluttering up the screen. However, give her
a go, as appearances can be very deceptive. EVE is functional way beyond
expectation, incredibly powerful, easy to use, and yes, is really only
around 70K bytes total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINDOWS 95:<br>
You need to have the file OLEPRO32.DLL, that resides in
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ directory. If it is not there, there are places that
you can download it from the Internet, or get it off another PC.<br>
The default external paint application is set to MSPAINT.EXE. This is Microsoft's
basic paint application supplied with all versions of Windows, however
the Win95 version only edits BMP files. You need a paint app that can handle
BMP, GIF and JPG. Go to the menu &quot;Control/EVE preferences...&quot;
and choose a more appropriate paint application -- don't forget to tick
the checkbox so that the new settings will be saved to the EVE.INI configuration
file.<br>
