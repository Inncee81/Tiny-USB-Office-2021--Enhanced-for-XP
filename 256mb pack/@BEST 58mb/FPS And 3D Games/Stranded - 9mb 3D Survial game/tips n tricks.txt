Stranded Tips & Tricks
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Sleep on trees 
Sleep on trees or in water if lions or raptors are nearby.
Run against a tree and hold your jump key in order to climb it.

2. Water storage
Use leafs at water wells in order to fill them with water.
This way you can always carry it with you.

3. Construction 
Build your buildings close to eachother. Pick an area close to the
sea with sufficient building area, berries, palm trees and a well.

4. Keep an eye on character status
Always pay attention to hunger, thirst and fatigue levels.
Always carry some food along with you.

5. Grain and hemp growing
You can plant the seeds of grain and hemp into the soil.
Let it grow for over 2 nights to attain maximum harvest.

6. Fishing bait 
Use worms as a fishing bait in order to catch more fish.
You can often find worms anywhere in the area without plants or stones.
The worm is automatically used as bait when you use a fishing pole.

7. Axe without hemp!
If you don't feel like harvesting hemp for an old man,
you can simply kill him. This is an alternative way of getting an axe.

8. More hemp
The old man's small hemp field will gradually generate more hemp to be
harvested. (3x3 hemp plants, each with 3 hemp leaves = 27 hemp leaves!)
You must sleep only one night, and already on the next morning there will
grow more hemp. Still works even if you killed the old man.
